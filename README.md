- 👋 Hi, I’m @magekt
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot including programing, also as you can see I am a bit lazy and have used the template
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, I am just trying to make sure I can make a Text based game right now, I know how coding works, so I am not sure if i should even say i am learing, I am just making what i can with stackoverflow and other educational websites as my go to whenever i am stuck
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Anything and everything, the catch being I understand the language.. though that goes out the window when I can just learn a new one while helping around.
- 📫 How to reach me if you do want to communicate? Well, leave a mail on kt.rule@gmail.com or maybe bother me somewhere like instagram @deepankarraina... I do have a discord, but i am not sure if I will ever even open that app again!
